title: Event Log Clear (wevtutil.exe)
id:
status: experimental
description: Detects the clearing of EventLogs through wevtutil (concise) as well as Clear-EventLog through CommandLine and CommandScript objects. Powershell cmdlet detection returns a lot of noise for the CommandScripts object, so filtering out SrcProcParentName may be required. *Note I had to take out the script part.
